### Description 
>The concept of bias is familiar enough, partly because it is deployed frequently and in different contexts. For example, we talk about biased jurors, biased procedures, biased laws, biased decisions, and biased people. But we also talk about bias as a feature of certain frames of mind, habits, dispositions, and mental processes. In most of these contexts, bias is seen as a kind of failing or a bad-making feature. Attributions of bias are hence often accusatory, or at least a matter of negative assessment. Although these phenomena are familiar, questions remain. Is bias is a single thing? Is bias always bad? Is bias always misleading? Can bias be eliminated? In Bias: A Philosophical Study (Oxford University Press, 2023), Thomas Kelly addresses a broad range of such questions. He develops a norm-theoretic account of what bias is, and then explores its implications. ﻿Robert Talisse is the W. Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University.

### Notes
重新开始听 NBN 并且再度感到兴奋，在成为 nerd 的路上越走越远。又一次思考[[播客]]的意义到底是什么。绝非系统学习——书籍，公开课显然更加适合这个目的。还是回到打开眼界和信息，这也是为什么在打开眼界之后（有的信息已经成为预设），一些播客就变得无聊和不再吸引人。所以制作播客另一方面还是要有自己深入思考。找到同温层，让自己沉浸在好的内容里。这又回到[[《模仿欲望》]]之中的深厚欲望。这是锻造深厚欲望的方法。

理性偏见，以及知识越多，偏见越重的反思。
